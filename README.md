## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
1. There are some problems when I share my project to github from Android Studio. I couldn't log in the github on Android.
2. The LICEcap couldn't record the screen successfully at the beginning and it worked after I 
unlock the privacy for screen monitoring in my computer.
